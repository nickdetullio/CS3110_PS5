Gary's Module Problem

With the provided BinaryTree interface, there is no way to call the elements of 
the tree.  While it is possible to see if an element exists at a given index, 
there is no way of extracting or modifying the element.  This makes it impossible 
to create a tree composed of all of the original trees elements modified by the 
given function f. Without Gary's module there is no way of completing the project
on time. Our group will have to hope to Zardoz that the mean for Problem Set 7 is
relatively low.
